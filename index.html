    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>QRXpress</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. This application collects minimal data
      necessary for app functionality and improving user experience. All features are designed to work with as little
      data as possible.</p>

    <h2>1. Permissions Used</h2>

      <li><strong>Gallery:</strong> To pick an image from your device to scan QR codes or barcodes from an image.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely for their stated purpose. Photos and images selected by the user remain on the
      device and are not uploaded or shared.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>QRXpress uses third-party services to improve app stability and performance:</p>

      as photos, videos, or files.</p>
